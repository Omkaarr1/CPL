# Security Policy for Custom Programming Language Interpreter

#### Purpose
This document outlines the security policies for the Custom Programming Language Interpreter project to ensure the protection of sensitive data, prevention of unauthorized access, and the secure execution of programs.

### Scope
This policy applies to all components of the interpreter, including:
- Lexer, Parser, and Interpreter modules
- Machine Learning, Blockchain, Data Science, and Database Libraries
- Encryption mechanisms
- Temporal programming features

### Security Goals
1. **Data Confidentiality**: Ensure sensitive data (e.g., encrypted variables) remains confidential.
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevent unauthorized modifications to variables, functions, and program logic.
3. **Operational Security**: Safeguard the runtime environment from malicious or unauthorized code execution.
4. **Access Control**: Restrict unauthorized access to external libraries and database connections.
5. **Secure Data Handling**: Ensure proper encryption and decryption mechanisms for encrypted variables and secure database interactions.

### Security Policies

#### 1. Encrypted Variables
- **Encryption Algorithms**: Use AES-256 for encrypting variables prefixed with `@ENC`.
- **Key Management**:
  - Keys are generated dynamically during runtime and are not stored persistently.
  - Keys must never be exposed in logs or error messages.
- **Data Access**:
  - Encrypted variables are decrypted only during execution and are re-encrypted immediately after computation.
  - Ensure decrypted values are cleared from memory post-operation.

#### 2. Machine Learning Integration
- **Data Sanitization**:
  - Validate CSV file inputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - Ensure only valid file paths are accepted.
- **Model Protection**:
  - Save models to a secure directory with restricted access.
  - Use checksum validation to ensure model integrity.

#### 3. Blockchain Functionality
- **Private Key Security**:
  - Private keys must be stored in memory only and should not be logged.
  - Encourage users to use environment variables for passing sensitive keys.
- **Transaction Validation**:
  - Validate transaction amounts and recipient addresses before processing.
  - Prevent double-spending or unauthorized transactions.
- **Hashing**:
  - Use SHA-256 for all hashing operations within the blockchain library.

#### 4. Data Science Operations
- **Secure File Handling**:
  - Allow only files from predefined directories.
  - Limit file sizes to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
- **Visualization Security**:
  - Output files (e.g., histograms) must be saved in secure directories.
  - Avoid overwriting existing files without confirmation.

#### 5. Database Operations
- **Connection Security**:
  - Use secure connections (e.g., SSL/TLS) to communicate with databases.
  - Avoid hardcoding database credentials; use environment variables or secure vaults.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**:
  - Parameterize all SQL queries to prevent injection attacks.
- **Resource Management**:
  - Ensure all database connections are closed properly to avoid leaks.
- **Data Sanitization**:
  - Validate user inputs before using them in queries.

#### 6. Temporal Programming (Event Triggers)
- **Execution Restrictions**:
  - Allow only trusted code to be scheduled for execution.
  - Ensure scheduled tasks cannot overwrite critical system files or access unauthorized resources.
- **Time Validation**:
  - Reject invalid time formats or overly frequent triggers that can cause resource exhaustion.

#### 7. Runtime Environment
- **Sandboxing**:
  - Execute programs in a restricted environment to limit access to system resources.
  - Prevent programs from accessing the file system outside designated directories.
- **Memory Safety**:
  - Enforce memory limits to prevent excessive usage by malicious scripts.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Ensure runtime errors do not expose sensitive system details or variables.
  - Log errors securely without exposing stack traces to end-users.

#### 8. Logging and Monitoring
- **Log Sanitization**:
  - Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data (e.g., keys, decrypted values, database credentials).
- **Audit Trails**:
  - Maintain detailed logs of blockchain transactions, database queries, and program executions.
- **Access Logs**:
  - Record all access attempts to the interpreter and external libraries.

#### 9. Third-Party Library Usage
- **Dependency Management**:
  - Regularly update all third-party libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
  - Verify the integrity of libraries (e.g., using checksums) before integration.
- **Library Restrictions**:
  - Limit external library access to only approved and tested functionalities.

#### 10. Secure Development Practices
- **Code Reviews**:
  - All changes to the codebase must be peer-reviewed.
- **Static Analysis**:
  - Regularly run static code analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Testing**:
  - Implement unit tests and integration tests for all critical features.
  - Use fuzz testing to identify vulnerabilities in input handling.

#### 11. User Responsibilities
- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensure input files follow the specified syntax and do not include malicious code.
- **Environment Security**:
  - Run the interpreter in secure environments.
  - Limit access to directories used by the interpreter.
- **Credential Management**:
  - Use secure methods (e.g., environment variables) to pass credentials and keys.

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Incident Detection**:
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
   - Set up alerts for unauthorized database access, invalid transactions, or excessive resource usage.
2. **Containment**:
   - Suspend the execution of potentially malicious scripts.
   - Revoke access to external libraries or databases if compromised.
3. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze logs and runtime states to identify the source of the issue.
   - Assess the scope of the impact on sensitive data and operations.
4. **Mitigation**:
   - Patch vulnerabilities in the interpreter or libraries.
   - Restore affected systems from backups.
5. **Recovery**:
   - Resume operations once the incident is resolved and verified.
   - Notify affected users about the incident and provide guidance for secure usage.
6. **Post-Incident Review**:
   - Document the incident, including its root cause, impact, and resolution.
   - Update security policies and codebase to prevent recurrence.

### Compliance
This project adheres to the following security standards:
- OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- GDPR for data protection where applicable
- Industry best practices for encryption and database security

### Review and Updates
This policy will be reviewed quarterly or after any major security incident or feature addition. Updates will be documented and communicated to all contributors.
